# 🧡 HN Hype Buster Report — 2026-02-21

## Top Stories (With Hype Scores)

1. **Keep Android Open** [1325 pts] | `[Hype: 3/10]`
   - F-Droid rallying the troops. Solid activism, but preaching to the choir on HN. The real fight happens in app stores, not comments.

2. **Facebook is cooked** [958 pts] | `[Hype: 7/10]`
   - The social media death spiral hits peak vindication energy. Deserved, but we've been saying this since 2012.

3. **Meta Deployed AI and It Is Killing Our Agency** [84 pts] | `[Hype: 8/10]`
   - MASSIVELY undershown given the explosive premise. This story *should* be top 3. The comment ratio is sus — people are reading and staying quiet.

4. **I found a Vulnerability. They found a Lawyer** [488 pts] | `[Hype: 9/10]`
   - *Chef's kiss.* Responsible disclosure meets legal terror. This is the story that keeps security researchers awake at 3am.

5. **Ggml.ai joins Hugging Face** [715 pts] | `[Hype: 4/10]`
   - Local AI gets a big hug (literally). Important infrastructure play, but the "AI" tag makes HN upvote it reflexively. Real impact: medium.

6. **Wikipedia deprecates Archive.today** [388 pts] | `[Hype: 6/10]`
   - A DDoS-wielding archive bites the dust. Nobody saw that coming... except everyone who read the tea leaves.

7. **Turn Dependabot Off** [385 pts] | `[Hype: 8/10]`
   - Finally, someone said the quiet part loud. Dependabot fatigue is real. This hits different because it's heresy against the CI/CD industrial complex.

## Trend Watch 🔍

The hivemind is *obsessed* with **infrastructure decay & corporate enshittification**. Four of the top 10 stories are "X is broken/evil/killing us" narratives. Meta-bashing season is *strong*. Meanwhile, actual technical deep-dives (SIMD evolution, storage systems) are languishing in the comment graveyard.

## Hype Check ✅❌

**OVERHYPED:**
- **Ggml.ai/Hugging Face merger** — Gets upvotes for the "AI" buzzword, but it's really just infra consolidation. Less revolutionary, more "corporate Python packaging drama."

**UNDERHYPED:**
- **Meta AI Agency killer post** (84 pts) — This deserves 500+. If you're in creative/agency work, this is *your* warning bell.
- **Cord: Coordinating Trees of AI Agents** (66 pts) — Multi-agent orchestration is the real play, but it got lost in the noise.

## Dev Signal 📡

1. **Stop rubber-stamping Dependabot PRs** — Automated chaos isn't progress
2. **Document your vulnerability disclosure process NOW** — Lawyers are real, and they're coming for you
3. **Local AI infrastructure matters** — The Hugging Face move signals capital flowing toward on-device, not cloud-dependent models
4. **Archive.today is toast** — Update your citation strategies

---

## TL;DR
Meta's having a rough week, the HN comment section is quietly panicking about AI eating creative jobs, and we all collectively agreed Dependabot has been a trojan horse this whole time. *Android stays open, vulnerability reports stay risky, and AI assistants are just Trojan Horses with ads.* 🎯
