# HN Hype Buster Report — Feb 17, 2026

## Top Stories with Hype Scores

**1. Miles Wu's Origami Breakthrough (582 pts)**
`[Hype: 7/10]` A 14-year-old folded something that holds 10k times its weight. This is genuinely cool — practical geometry meets engineering. Not hype, just *actual* innovation. The hivemind is right to care.

**2. Bluetooth Privacy Deep Dive (386 pts)**
`[Hype: 6/10]` "What your Bluetooth devices reveal" — turns out your wireless earbuds are snitches. Solid security research that'll make you paranoid at exactly the right time.

**3. Dark Web Agent Rescue Story (344 pts)**
`[Hype: 8/10]` A girl rescued via a bedroom wall clue spotted by a dark web agent. This is *actually* heroic. HN's moral outrage dial is calibrated correctly here — fold it in, not away.

**4. PyTorch Visual Intro (212 pts)**
`[Hype: 5/10]` Another PyTorch tutorial. Useful, but we've seen 47 of these. It's like asking "what's the best way to learn TensorFlow?" — the answer is yes, they're all fine.

**5. Emulator News: Rise of the Triforce (220 pts)**
`[Hype: 4/10]` Dolphin emulator post. Fine for retro fans, but the actual technical meat isn't jumping off the screen here.

## Trend Watch

The hivemind is bifurcating: **hardcore nerd history** (ASCII columns, DBASE on Kaypro, Apple .car formats) vs. **practical breakthroughs** (origami engineering, Show HN projects). The middle ground? Sparse. Also noticing a surge in "AI agents doing things" posts — the echo chamber is *still* obsessed, even as reality checks mount.

## Hype Check

**Overhyped:**
- AGENTS.md (61 pts) — "Are coding agents helpful?" spoiler: jury's still out, but HN acts like the question is settled
- Side project AI post (45 pts) — "building for an audience of one" + AI is catnip, but execution matters more than the recipe

**Underhyped:**
- Scanned 1927-1945 USFS Work Diary (83 pts) — Hidden gem showing real history. Should be top 5
- Free Whisper Alternative (162 pts) — Show HN doing actual work, solving a real problem. Deserves more oxygen than it's getting

## Dev Signal

**Ship this:** origami engineering principles for structural design, Bluetooth privacy audit workflows, Show HN projects (actual code beats pontification).

**Skip this:** another .md format debate, "thinking hard destroys workouts" (what even is this doing here?).

---

## TL;DR
Today's HN: one genuinely brilliant teen, one genuinely heroic rescue, three discussions nobody should fork. The orange site is *folding* under its own hype weight — nice pun — but the signal exists if you dig past the noise.
