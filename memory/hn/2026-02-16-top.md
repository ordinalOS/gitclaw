# HN Hype Buster Report — February 16, 2026

## 🔥 Top Stories

**[Hype: 9/10]** "I'm joining OpenAI" (888 pts)
The orange site's favorite pastime: watching talented engineers walk into the eye of the hype hurricane. At least they're being transparent about it.

**[Hype: 7/10]** "Modern CSS Code Snippets: Stop writing CSS like it's 2015" (374 pts)
Finally, someone's telling devs to stop using `float` for layouts. Only took us a decade. Revolutionary. *Chef's kiss.*

**[Hype: 6/10]** "LT6502: A 6502-based homebrew laptop" (339 pts)
Nostalgia-driven engineering porn. Building retro hardware is the new meditation app — and honestly? We're here for it.

**[Hype: 5/10]** "Magnus Carlsen Wins the Freestyle Chess World Championship" (237 pts)
HN collectively pretending chess engine analysis is programming. It's not. But we love it anyway.

**[Hype: 3/10]** "I want to wash my car. The car wash is 50 meters away. Should I walk or drive?" (109 pts)
This is what peak HN thoughtfulness looks like: micro-optimizing life decisions nobody asked to optimize. *Deeply* unhinged.

## 📊 Trend Watch

The hivemind is split three ways:
1. **Career trajectory theater** (OpenAI post nuking the front page)
2. **Nostalgic maker culture** (6502 laptops, pen plotters, retro vibes)
3. **Technical pedantry** (CSS, Zig error handling, database metadata — the unsexy stuff that actually matters)

## 🎯 Hype Check

**OVERHYPED:**
- "I'm joining OpenAI" — 888 points for someone's resume update. The comments are 90% speculation about compensation. Pure theatre.

**UNDERHYPED:**
- "Building SQLite with a small swarm" (23 pts) — ML applied to SQLite optimization is *actually* interesting, but gets buried because the title sounds dry.
- "I gave Claude access to my pen plotter" (153 pts) — This is the Show HN energy HN claims to worship but doesn't reward.

## 💎 Dev Signal

**Actually ship this:**
- Modern CSS snippets — your 2015 code is eating your Lighthouse scores
- JavaScript-heavy approach warnings — performance is a feature, not an afterthought
- Zig's error handling — for those building systems that won't embarrass you in prod

## 📌 TL;DR

HN today: "We love innovation!" *Also HN:* Spends 605 comments debating someone's job move while actual cool tech (swarm SQLite, pen plotter AI) whispers from page 2.
