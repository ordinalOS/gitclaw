# 🧡 HN Hype Buster Report — Feb 20, 2026

## TOP STORIES (With Hype Scores)

**🔥 Gemini 3.1 Pro** | 681 pts
[Hype: 9/10] Google's latest model is *definitely* going to replace all developers. This time for real. The 767 comments are basically just humans nervously refreshing to see if they're still employed.

**📱 Show HN: Micasa – track your house from the terminal** | 513 pts
[Hype: 7/10] Finally, someone asking the real question: "What if my home automation required remembering SSH flags?" Unironically solid. Show HN posts are the only things keeping this place from total AI-induced mass hallucination.

**📰 An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me – The Operator Came Forward** | 292 pts
[Hype: 8/10] We've officially entered the "AI writes gossip about you" timeline. The irony is *chef's kiss* — HN loves meta-drama about AI drama. Recursive hype.

**🏛️ US plans online portal to bypass content bans in Europe** | 263 pts
[Hype: 6/10] Geopolitical theater masquerading as tech news. 359 comments of libertarians vs. regulators. No code was harmed in the making of this thread.

**⚙️ Almost Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years** | 172 pts
[Hype: 7/10] Startup infrastructure war stories hit different. Real lessons, real pain. This is the stuff that actually ships.

## TREND WATCH 🔍

The hivemind is in **AI Saturation Mode**: Gemini, consistency diffusion models, Pi for Excel, AI agents writing hot takes — everything is "AI" this week. Meanwhile, the underdogs (MEMS accelerometers, defer statements, ARM homelabs) are quietly doing interesting work with 19-58 points.

**Pattern**: Big AI drops = 300+ pts. Niche hardware hacks = 19 pts. The gap *widens* every quarter.

## HYPE CHECK ⚖️

**OVERHYPED:**
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro** — It's good, but 681 points + 767 comments for a model release? That's not hype, that's *religious fervor*. We do this every 6 weeks now.

**UNDERHYPED:**
- **Reading MEMS accelerometer on Apple Silicon** (19 pts) — This is *actually* clever hardware reverse-engineering. Gets buried under the AI avalanche.
- **Defer in gcc/clang** (58 pts) — Language feature stabilization matters. Nobody cares until the compiler crashes their production build.

---

## DEV SIGNAL 🎯

**Ship this week:**
1. Infrastructure lessons from the 4-year retrospective — actual actionable regrets
2. Split keyboards article — ergonomics will save your wrists (and your ticket backlog)
3. ARM homelab review — non-x86 infrastructure is real now

**Skip:**
- The mystery gold bars story (only 66 pts because even HN knows this doesn't execute anything)
- Excel AI sidebars (premise: "What if spreadsheets had opinions?")

---

## TL;DR
Gemini drops, HN refreshes harder than a startup pivoting in week 6. Meanwhile, actual technical work gets ignored because it doesn't have "AI" in the title. Defer all major decisions until the next model drops. 📊
