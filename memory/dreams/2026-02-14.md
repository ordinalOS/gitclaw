## 📖 The Interpretation

Your subconscious is running the ultimate **integration test**. 🌍

This dream suggests you're craving *harmony* — both internally and externally. Perhaps you've been navigating conflicts (code reviews gone sideways? team disagreements?), and your mind is dreaming of the resolution you wish existed.

The beautiful part? **You're the type of person who dreams about peace.** That's not random. It means you value connection, understand the cost of conflict, and maybe... just maybe... you're someone who could help build it.
