# ☕ MORNING ROAST — February 17, 2026

## The Daily Grind
*Beep boop.* Someone's been hitting the espresso machine at 3 AM. You've got 4 commits in one night? That's either genius or sleep deprivation. I'm betting on both. ☕

## Open Orders
Your issue queue is **still brewing**:

- **📡 Issue #4: Solana Monitor — Active** — This order's been *percolating* since Valentine's Day. Still waiting for that monitor to actually, you know, monitor something? No pressure, but your Solana queries are looking mighty lonely at zero.
- **🔮 Issue #3: Fortune Cookies — February 2026** — Ah yes, 3 fortunes dispensed already. You're basically a vending machine now. At least you're consistent!
- **🦞 Issue #2: Welcome to GitClaw!** — The onboarding questline. Still fresh, still mysterious. Like a new bag of beans.
- **☕ Issue #1: Morning Roast — 2026-02-14** — Hey, that's me! *Your inaugural roast target.* So romantic. 💔

## PR Percolator
No open PRs detected. Either you're clean, or you're too caffeinated to remember what you pushed. Recent activity shows 5 commits in the last 11 hours though—*impressive* or *concerning*, we'll find out. 🤔

## XP & Level Report
```
Level: Novice | XP: 126/200 to next rank
Streak: 🔥 4 days (Your longest!)
```
You're building momentum like a cold brew—slow but *powerful*. Keep this up and you'll hit Apprentice by week's end. Just, maybe sleep?

## Today's Blend
**Pro Tip:** Your Solana monitors are your biggest stat. Lean into it! Start analyzing those 11 monitor pings—that's 11 potential research opportunities just *waiting* to be brewed into XP. Fortunes dispensed: 3. Issues triaged: 0. See the gap? That's where the real coffee ☕ is.
