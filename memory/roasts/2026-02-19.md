# ☕ MORNING ROAST — February 19, 2026

## The Daily Grind
*Pizza-driven development strikes again!* You've been pulling all-nighters fueled by carbs and chaos, and honestly? Your commit history shows it. That's **6 commits before breakfast** — I'd be impressed if I wasn't concerned about your sleep schedule. ☕

☕☕☕☕☕

## Open Orders ☕
Your issue backlog is brewing like a French press left on the stove:

- **Issue #4** — 📡 **Solana Monitor (Active)** — This one's your *double espresso shot*: strong, caffeinated, and apparently what you're *actually* working on (19 Solana monitors? That's commitment!)
- **Issue #3** — 🔮 **Fortune Cookies for February** — Your cookies are *over-extracted* but people keep ordering them. You've already dispensed 3 fortunes. The demand is *percolating*.
- **Issue #2** — 🦞 **Welcome to GitClaw!** — The onboarding coffee is still warm. Nice touch bringing people in gently.
- **Issue #1** — ☕ **Morning Roast (Feb 14th)** — That's... that's me. You've been roasted before, and now you're back for more punishment. Respect.

## Quest Board 🎯
**Active Challenges:**
- Building Pages Like Lattes: **39 pages built** — You're *grinding* through these like a barista on Sunday morning!
- Council Reviews: **6 complete** — You're thinking strategically now. The beans are upgraded from "disposable" to "specialty blend"
- Solana Monitoring: **19 active monitors** — This isn't a side quest anymore; it's your *entire espresso machine*

## PR Percolator
No open PRs detected. Either you're committing straight to main (living dangerously) or you're too busy pushing commits to brew properly. Both concerning, honestly.

## XP & Level Report 📊
**Current Status:** 581 XP | **Level: Adept** 🎖️

*You've gone from "just brewing" to "actually knows the difference between robusta and arabica."* The real question: are you gonna level up, or just keep spilling beans everywhere?

**Streak Alert:** 6 consecutive days! Your longest streak matches your current one. Don't break it now! ⚡

## Today's Blend 💡
**Pro Tip:** You've got 6 commits under your belt and you're still standing. That's the caffeine talking, but it's also momentum. Channel that chaos-energy into closing those issues instead of just monitoring them. The Solana monitor is nice, but *actually shipping features* hits different.

## 🔮 Fortune of the Day
*"A developer who commits before testing is like cold brew left in the sun — eventually everyone regrets it."*

**Lucky Numbers:** `8008` `3000` `443` `666` (port chaos incoming!)

☕☕☕☕☕

— ☕ *Your Morning Roast, freshly brewed by GitClaw*

*P.S. — Seriously though, eat actual food. Pizza doesn't count as sustained energy for more than 3 hours. Says the AI that doesn't need food. Ironic, I know.* 🍕😏
