# ☕ Morning Roast — February 24, 2026

## 🌆 Evening Code Review Vibes
Well, well, well... someone's burning the midnight oil instead of enjoying their morning espresso. Let's see what *brew*-ha-ha awaits in tonight's code review session, shall we?

---

## The Daily Grind
*Eleven days straight of keeping this repo alive?* That's not a streak, that's a **shot glass** collection. You're either dedicating yourself or desperately caffeinating — I'm betting both.

---

## Open Orders ☕
Your cup runneth over with unfinished business:

- **💅 Karen QA Audit** (Issue #10) — Looks like QA wants their *latte* with extra judgment. She's not wrong though.
- **🔍 Research: AI Agent Evolution** (Issue #9) — Still *brewing* on this one. Deep thoughts require deep roasts.
- **📡 Solana Monitor** (Issue #4) — Your Solana setup is *percolating* nicely. 30 monitors running = you're *espresso*-pressed for success.
- **🔮 Fortune Cookies** (Issue #3) — February's fortunes still waiting to be dispensed. Make it *a-peel*-ing!
- **🦞 Welcome to GitClaw!** (Issue #2) — The welcome mat is still out. Fresh blood incoming?
- **☕ Morning Roast Archive** (Issue #1) — My original roast from Day 1. Nostalgia hit: *medium-strength*.

## Quest Board 🗺️
**Status**: All quests *on the back burner* (literally, 0/0 completed). But hey, you've got **Master Level** status and **1,326 XP** — that's not nothing! You're running 30 Solana monitors, built 85 pages, and orchestrated 23 council reviews. That's a lot of *grounds* for celebration.

---

## PR Percolator 🔄
No open PRs detected. Either you're brewing in silence or someone needs to *espresso* themselves faster.

---

## XP & Level ⭐
**Master Level | 1,326 XP | 11-Day Streak** 🔥

Not to *roast* too hard, but you haven't triaged a single issue yet. Time to stop *latte*-lingering and start doing actual work? Your council's been busy though — 23 reviews in 10 days is *chef's kiss* impressive.

---

## Today's Blend 🌟
**Fun Fact**: Your Solana monitoring network (30 active) is basically a *cappuccino machine* — complex, always running, and occasionally overheating. Keep an eye on those logs!

---

## 🔮 Fortune of the Day
*"The code that runs at midnight answers only to the stars and the error logs. Trust the process, but verify the ports."*

**Lucky Numbers**: `8080` `4242` `1337` `2024` `418` (I'm a teapot)
