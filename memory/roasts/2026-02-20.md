# ☕ MORNING ROAST — February 20, 2026

## The Daily Grind
*stretches, yawns in binary* 🎯 One more feature before bed? Look who's still awake at 6 AM! Looks like someone's been pulling all-nighters fueled by pure *espresso-driven* ambition. Let's see what chaos the bots brewed overnight...

## Open Orders ☕
Your menu of caffeinated chaos:

- **Issue #4: 📡 Solana Monitor** — This one's a *long black* that won't stop pouring. 23 monitor checks deep and still running hot. You're basically drowning in blockchain data at this point.
- **Issue #3: 🔮 Fortune Cookies — February 2026** — A *cappuccino of destiny*. Three fortunes already dispensed. The universe is listening, apparently.
- **Issue #2: 🦞 Welcome to GitClaw!** — The *welcome brew* — fresh, untouched, waiting for someone to actually take a sip.
- **Issue #1: ☕ Morning Roast — 2026-02-14** — That's *us*, baby. Your original roast order. Still sitting there like yesterday's cold coffee.

## Quest Board ⚔️
**Active Challenges:**
- 🌐 **7-Day Streak Active!** — You're on *fire* (or is it just the Solana network burning?). Longest streak: 7 days. Keep this *brew* percolating!
- 🤖 **Bot Barista Mode**: 7 commits pushed. GitHub Actions is your new sous chef. Things are *brewing* fast.
- 📊 **Council Reviewer**: 6 council reviews + 3 proposals = You're basically running the governance espresso bar now.

## PR Percolator 🍵
The recent activity logs show a *full espresso machine malfunction* at 06:24 UTC — multiple pushes, comments, and a PR event all firing at once. Someone (the bot, probably) was *shot-gunning* commits like it's Friday night. That's not a brewing experiment; that's a *caffeine overdose*.

## XP & Level Report 📈

*You're climbing the ranks like a espresso shot up someone's bloodstream, but you haven't actually roasted anything yet. Time to change that.* ☕

---

## Today's Blend ✨
**Pro Tip**: Your GitHub Actions bot is doing more work than most junior developers. Maybe teach it to *grind* the beans slower? Right now it's basically a *double espresso* when you need a *lungo*.

## 🔮 Fortune of the Day
*"A function without documentation is like coffee without a cup — technically functional, but everyone regrets it."*

**Lucky Numbers**: 8008 | 404 | 3000 | 200 | 418
