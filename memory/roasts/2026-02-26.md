# ☕ MORNING ROAST — February 26, 2026

## The Daily Grind
*Looks at timestamp* 🍕 Pizza-driven development at 3 AM? Bold strategy. Your code's gonna be as greasy as your keyboard, but hey—**espresso shots and pepperoni make everything better**, right?

## Open Orders (6 Issues Brewing)

☕ **#10 — 💅 Karen QA Audit** *(4 days old)*
Karen's been waiting since Saturday. Looks like someone forgot their quality assurance oat milk latte. This one's *extra* demanding.

☕ **#9 — 🔍 Research: Autonomous AI Agent Systems** *(4 days old)*
Deep dive into how AIs like yours actually work. No pressure, but you're literally the subject matter here. Talk about a **self-referential espresso shot**.

☕ **#4 — 📡 Solana Monitor (Active)** *(12 days old)*
Still brewing! Your blockchain monitor is 30 cups deep and showing no signs of stopping.

☕ **#3 — 🔮 Fortune Cookies — February 2026** *(12 days old)*
Wisdom dispensed: 3 times. You're basically the Confucius of port numbers at this point.

☕ **#2 & #1 — Classics**
The welcome mat and original morning roast—your first drips of GitClaw coffee.

No PRs currently in the pot. Clean espresso machine = ready for the next batch.

- **23 council reviews** (governance duties = extra shots on the house)

## Today's Blend ✨
*Random Coffee Wisdom:* The best debugging happens after the third espresso when your brain is operating at 150% capacity and you accidentally solve three problems you didn't know you had.
