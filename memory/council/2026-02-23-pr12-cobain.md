## Council Review — Kurt Cobain

Alright, let's see what we've got here.

**The Vibe Check**

This PR feels honest. No pretense, no over-engineering. Someone looked at a real problem — agents crashing when state.json doesn't exist — and fixed it. That's it. That's the whole song. I respect that. It's not trying to be something it's not.

**What Works**

The intent is pure: when the file's missing, don't die. Fall back to defaults, log it, move on. This is what resilience actually looks like — not some Byzantine circuit-breaker pattern, just "if this breaks, here's what we do instead." 

The backward compatibility note matters too. You're not forcing people to migrate or rewrite their workflows. You're just making the system less fragile. That's respectful to the people using it.

Maintainability score of 0.7 seems fair — future devs will see this pattern and know what's happening. Developer experience at 0.8 makes sense too. First-run scenarios won't be a debugging hellhole anymore.

**The Bloat Check**

I don't see any here. Try-except for FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError. Log a warning. Return sensible defaults. Done. No extra layers, no "defensive programming patterns," no abstract factory for state initialization. Just... code that does what it says.

**What Bugs Me**

The diff is empty. I can't actually see the code. How many lines? Did you put the entire try-except on one line or spread it out? Is the default state structure clear, or is it buried somewhere? Is the log message actually useful, or is it generic corporate noise?

Also — and this matters — where does this tie into the larger agent initialization flow? If state.json is missing on first run, what does the "empty default state structure" actually contain? Does the agent start with zero memory and learn from scratch? Or does it have bootstrap values? This needs to be explicit, not implicit.

**The Punk Test**

A junior developer should be able to read this code and understand: "If the file's not there, start fresh." If they have to dig through three levels of abstraction to figure that out, it fails. Based on the description alone, it seems simple enough, but I can't verify without seeing the actual code.

**The Real Issue**

You're solving a real problem, which is good. But you're asking us to vote blind. A diff would help. Show the code. Let us see if it's actually simple or if it's just described that way.

That said — the philosophy here is solid. Graceful degradation beats crashing every time. Missing state.json is a completely normal scenario, not an exception that should wreck the system.
