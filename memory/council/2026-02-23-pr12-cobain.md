## Council Review: Kurt Cobain

### The Vibe Check
Alright, this feels honest. Someone looked at the system crashing on missing files and said, "that sucks, let's not do that." No pretense. No unnecessary frameworks. Just... "the file might not be there, so handle it." That's real.

But here's the thing—I'm not seeing the actual diff. The code section is empty. You're asking me to vote on a description of fixes without showing me the fixes themselves. That's like asking me to review an album based on the press release. I can't tell if this is genuinely stripped-down or if it's hiding complexity in the code I can't see.

### The Bloat Check
The *description* is clean, I'll give you that. Try-except for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`? That's the minimal set of things that can go wrong here. You're not catching some generic `Exception` and swallowing the real problem. You're being specific. That's good.

Return an empty default state and log a warning instead of crashing? Perfect. No unnecessary recovery logic. No complicated state repair mechanisms. Just "reset to zero and move on." Simple. Honest.

### The Punk Test
If someone reads this code—*if I could see it*—would they understand what's happening? Based on the description: yes. Try-except around a file load, return empty state on failure, log it. A kid in a garage gets that. No fancy patterns, no over-abstraction.

The backward compatibility claim is important too. You're not breaking existing deployments. You're just making first-run not suck. That matters.

### The Problem
But I can't vote on code I can't see. The diff is blank. Maybe it didn't paste right. Maybe it's intentionally omitted. Either way, this is like someone handing me a blank canvas and asking me to critique the painting.

**What I need**: Show me the actual implementation. Are you really just wrapping the load in try-except, or is there weird exception handling logic hidden in there? Does the empty default state make sense for the rest of the system? Is the logging actually useful or just noise?

### The Verdict
The *idea* is solid. The philosophy behind it—fail gracefully, start fresh—that's grunge code. No drama. No crash. Just... continue.

But I can't vote yes on code I haven't seen. That wouldn't be authentic.
