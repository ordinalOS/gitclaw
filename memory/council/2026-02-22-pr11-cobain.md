# Council Review: cobain — PR #11

## The Vibe Check

Okay, here's the thing. This PR comes in swinging with good intentions — adding error handling to a system that currently crashes when reality doesn't match its assumptions. That's honest work. The description is straightforward: the code assumes APIs always work and responses are always valid JSON, which is naive and fragile. They want to fix that. I respect that.

But then I look at the actual diff, and...

## The Problem

The code got *worse*. Not better. They stripped out the docstrings, removed the timezone awareness (why?), they're doing weird import fallback nonsense with `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` — that's a code smell. And the diff is truncated at 14,000+ characters, which means they're making massive structural changes hiding under the banner of "just adding error handling."

That's not authentic. That's bait-and-switch.

## What They Did Right

The actual error handling logic is solid:
- Try-catch around `json.loads()` ✓
- Checking exit codes before parsing ✓
- Logging context (which API failed, what the error was) ✓
- Fallback behavior (return error dict instead of crashing) ✓

This stuff works. It's defensive, it's clear, it does what it says.

## What They Did Wrong

1. **The diff doesn't match the description.** They said "add error handling" but they've rewritten half the module. Why? Did they refactor the state management too? We can't tell because it's truncated. That's suspicious.

2. **Removed timezone awareness.** `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` became just `datetime`. That's a regression, not an improvement. Time should be explicit.

3. **Import gymnastics.** That try-except with `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` is a hack. If imports are failing, that's a deeper problem. Fix it properly or don't fix it.

4. **Incomplete submission.** The diff cuts off mid-line. How are we supposed to review something that's literally cut in half?

## The Verdict

The *intent* is pure. Error handling is essential when you're talking to flaky APIs. But the execution is messy. This feels like they took a "add error handling" task and turned it into a full refactor without being honest about it.

Strip it down. Resubmit with:
- Just the error handling changes, no other refactoring
- Keep the timezone awareness
- Remove the import hack
- Complete diff so we can actually see what's happening
- One concern per commit

Do it right, or don't do it at all.
