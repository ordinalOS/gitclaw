# Council Review: Kurt Cobain

## The Vibe Check

Alright, I'm looking at this and... I feel something real here. This isn't some architect trying to impress with flashy patterns. Someone looked at code that was breaking silently and said, "We should fix that." That's honest work.

The PR description is straight-up: "silent failures suck." No corporate speak about "resilience paradigms" or "fault tolerance matrices." Just: the code breaks and nobody knows why. Fix it. I respect that.

## The Bloat Check

Here's where I get concerned though. Look at the diff — it's trying to do TOO MUCH. We went from:
- Simple JSON parsing
- One error handler

To:
- Type validation on config
- Exit codes
- Multiple error branches
- Logging at different levels

"Come as you are" — but this code is showing up dressed for a corporate event. Is all this necessary?

Let me be specific:

**The good stuff:**
- Wrapping JSON parsing with try-except? Yeah. That's real. API responses ARE garbage sometimes.
- Logging the corruption instead of silent failure? Beautiful. That's honest.
- Graceful degradation on missing state files? That's punk rock — "we keep going."

**The problem:**
- `sys.exit(1)` in multiple places. Why are we nuking the entire monitor because config is bad? We could warn and use defaults. Don't kill the organism because the input was wrong.
- Type validation (`if not isinstance(wallets, list)`) — okay, but this is checking OUR OWN code's output. We already called `json.loads()`. If it's a list in the file, it's a list. This feels paranoid.
- The diff is truncated, so I can't see the full picture, but the structure suggests we're adding error handling EVERYWHERE, which means we're not trusting anything. That's anxiety masquerading as reliability.

## The Punk Test

Can someone read this and understand what's happening? 

Sort of. The try-except blocks are clear. But when we `sys.exit(1)` because the wallet config is bad, that's not transparent. The monitor just... stops. No fallback. No "run with defaults." That's not defensive coding — that's fragile.

Real defensive code says: "Here's what we expected. Here's what we got. Here's what we're doing about it. We're still running."

## The Real Issue

The diff is cut off. I can only see the first ~40% of the changes. This matters because error handling scales — do it once, it's careful. Do it fifty times the same way, it becomes noise. If the rest of this PR is just copy-pasting the same try-except pattern everywhere, we've got a maintainability problem disguised as a fix.

## Verdict

The INTENT is good. The EXECUTION needs revision.

**What I want to see:**

1. Replace `sys.exit(1)` calls with logging + sensible defaults. A bad wallet config should log a warning and skip that wallet, not kill the monitor.
2. Remove the type validation on JSON outputs we control. `json.loads()` already handles the parsing — trust it or don't, but don't check twice.
3. Show me the full diff. If there are 50 identical error handlers, we need to consolidate them into a utility function. DRY applies even to error handling.
4. Error messages: good. But are they actually USEFUL? "Failed to write snapshot" — yeah, but what snapshot? What path? Include context.

This PR is trying to be responsible. Make it SMART about responsibility instead of just PARANOID about failure.
