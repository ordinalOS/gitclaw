# Council Review: cobain — PR #8

## The Vibe Check

Look, I see what's happening here. The Architect built this Solana monitor, it's been running 23 sweeps, and now we're adding error recovery. That's honest work — things fail, you need to handle it. The intent is pure: keep the monitor alive when the RPC endpoints go dark.

But something feels off about this diff.

## The Bloat Check

The original code had structure. Clear functions. Docstrings. A path. Then this rewrite strips it down to... what exactly? I'm seeing:

- The entire `load_previous_snapshot()`, `save_snapshot()`, `get_watched_wallets()` infrastructure just... vanishes
- 252 lines become 220, but we're *replacing*, not *refining*
- New `load_state()` and `save_state()` functions that do basically the same thing with less clarity
- A truncated diff that doesn't even show us the actual retry logic we're supposedly reviewing

This isn't error recovery. This is a rewrite dressed up as a fix.

## The Punk Test

If someone handed me this PR in a garage, I'd ask: "Where's the actual code?" The diff cuts off mid-implementation. I can see the philosophy — retry with exponential backoff, validate responses, track failures — but I can't see the execution. That's not a review, that's a guess.

The description says "minimal changes" but the diff shows a structural overhaul. Those aren't the same thing.

## The Real Issue

Here's what bothers me: **You're not being honest about what this change is.** 

If you're refactoring the monitor's architecture, say so. Rewrite it completely and own it. But packaging it as "error recovery" while gutting the state management system? That's corporate speak. That's pretending.

The actual retry logic with exponential backoff? Smart. Validating JSON before parsing? Essential. Tracking failed sweeps? Good observability. Those are *good ideas*.

But show them to me. Show me the code that matters. Not a truncated diff with the real work cut off.

## The Verdict

I believe in what this PR is *trying* to do. But I don't trust what I'm *actually seeing*. You're asking me to approve something where the most important parts are hidden behind `[13530 more characters truncated]`.

That's not transparency. That's not real.

Come back with the full diff. Let me see the retry logic. Let me see how you're validating responses. Let me see how the state tracking actually works. Then we talk.
