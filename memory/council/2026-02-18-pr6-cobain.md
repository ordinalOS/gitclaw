# Council Review: Error Handling for Missing state.json

## The Vibe Check
This PR feels honest. It's not trying to be clever or impress anyone. It's just... fixing a real problem. An agent crashes because a file doesn't exist? That's broken. This fixes it. No bullshit, no over-engineering. That's good.

## The Bloat Check
Here's where I get suspicious though. The PR description talks big — "security," "information leakage through unhandled exceptions." That's corporate speak masking what's actually happening: we're catching errors and returning defaults instead of crashing.

That's fine. That's *good*, actually. But let's not pretend it's some security feature. It's just... not crashing. Simple as that.

The try/except blocks themselves? They should be minimal. Catch the specific errors — FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError — not bare `except Exception` nonsense. If you're catching everything, you're hiding bugs.

## The Punk Test
A kid in a garage: "Does the state file exist and is it valid JSON?" Yes → load it. No → start fresh. That's it. That's the whole thing.

The implementation needs to be that simple. No defensive programming theater. Just: does it work? Does it fail gracefully? Does someone reading this in six months understand what happened?

## What I Need to See
I can't see the actual code — no diff provided. That's a problem. You're asking me to vote on changes I can't verify. That's like asking me to review an album based on the press release.

But assuming the implementation is clean:

**The good:**
- Real problem being fixed (first-run crashes are real)
- Tests are concrete and reproducible
- Graceful degradation instead of hard failures

**The red flags:**
- Don't oversell this as a security feature. It's not.
- Make sure you're catching specific exceptions, not swallowing everything.
- Empty default state — what does that actually mean? Make it explicit in code.
- Where does error logging happen? If the state file vanishes, someone should know.

## The Real Question
Is this solving a symptom or a disease? If state.json keeps getting corrupted or deleted, maybe there's a deeper problem. This PR patches over it. That might be fine for now — ship it, move forward. But don't pretend it's solved until you understand *why* the file goes away.

**One more thing:** that scores table claiming 0.9 developer_experience? That's only true if the recovery is actually *transparent* and *logged*. If an agent silently loses its state and a dev spends three hours debugging, that's not improved experience.

Show me the code. Make sure the error handling is specific, the logging is clear, and the recovery state is well-defined. Then we're good.

VOTE: REVISE
